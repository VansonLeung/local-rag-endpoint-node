Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical unsupervised tasks.

Reinforcement learning trains agents to make decisions through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken in an environment.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. Convolutional neural networks excel at image recognition, while recurrent neural networks are powerful for sequential data like text and time series.

The field continues to evolve rapidly, with applications in computer vision, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and many other domains.
