Traditional Italian Pasta Carbonara Recipe

Pasta Carbonara is a classic Roman dish known for its simplicity and rich, creamy texture. This traditional recipe serves 4 people and takes about 30 minutes to prepare.

Ingredients:
- 400g guanciale or pancetta, diced
- 500g spaghetti or rigatoni
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1 whole egg
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt (for pasta water)

Instructions:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook pasta according to package directions until al dente.

2. While pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced guanciale and cook until crispy and golden, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water.

3. In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, grated Pecorino Romano, and plenty of black pepper.

4. When pasta is done, reserve 1 cup of cooking water, then drain pasta. Do not rinse.

5. Working quickly, add hot pasta to the skillet with guanciale. Toss to combine and coat pasta with rendered fat.

6. Remove skillet from heat. Pour in egg mixture and toss vigorously to create a creamy sauce. The residual heat will cook the eggs without scrambling them.

7. If sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached.

8. Serve immediately with additional grated cheese and black pepper.

Tips:
- Use room temperature eggs for best results
- Guanciale is traditional, but pancetta works well
- Work quickly to prevent eggs from scrambling
- The sauce should be creamy, not runny

This authentic Carbonara captures the essence of Roman cuisine with its perfect balance of saltiness from the cured meat, sharpness from the cheese, and creaminess from the eggs.
